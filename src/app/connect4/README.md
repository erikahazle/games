# Connect 4

This is a basic game

## Â Still to do

[] Add tests for the UI
[] Display Player turn
[] Show a proper modal when a player wins; dismissing it should should restart a fresh game
[] Connect to an AI API, so 1 player would be sufficient
[] Introduce eslint
[] Refactor some of the main page code to make it cleaner
[] Allow the first user to setup the game - the size of the board and how many cells they need to match to win
